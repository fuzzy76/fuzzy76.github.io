# My homepage

My personal website. Used to be Wordpress. Now it isn't. :) 

This is a work in progress. I'll finish theme, plugins and content in that order.

## Tech stack

* [Github pages](https://help.github.com/categories/customizing-github-pages/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
* [Disqus](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/1104788-web-integration)

## License

I'm not licensing this out in any way. It's open source, but still mine. I
really don't see any reason to change that for now.

## Design considerations

I am not a designer, so I'm relying on Bootstrap and Bootswatch for typography,
colors and components.

## Structure

This site contains a static frontpage, serving as an "about me" page as well as
two blog categories. The blog is divided into english and norwegian posts. The
former will be mostly technical articles, whiles the latter will be mostly
related to the discourse within Norway. There are also some hidden blog posts
mostly because I didn't want to delete my ancient "dear diary" posts, but didn't
see any reason to list them.

## Jekyll-plugins

Relies on the following Jekyll plugins:
* [jekyll-gist](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-gist)
* [jekyll-relative-links](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-relative-links)
* [jekyll-default-layout](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-default-layout)
* [jekyll-titles-from-headings](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-titles-from-headings)

Will rely on:
* [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed)
* [jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)
* [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
