# My homepage

My personal website. Used to be Wordpress. Now it isn't. :) 

This is a work in progress. I'll finish theme, plugins and content in that order.

## License

I'm not licensing this out in any way. It's open source, but still mine. I
really don't see any reason to change that for now.

## Jekyll-plugins

Relies on the following Jekyll plugins:
