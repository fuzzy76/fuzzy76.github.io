This is a webdesigners dream&#8230; Haven&#8217;t you wished there was a way to quickly test a page in different versions of IE? If you&#8217;ve tried, you probably know that installing Internet Explorer will overwrite any verion currently installed. One install at a time. Bah humbug!

The rescue comes in the form of [IE standalone distributions from evolt.org](http://browsers.evolt.org/?ie/32bit/standalone). Just download (I tried the 9x version under Windows XP), unzip, doubleclick iexplore.exe and off you go! Note that the about dialog will display the version of your current system IE install, so there&#8217;s no way of knowing which IE you&#8217;re running without remembering which version you launched or looking at the HTTP headers.

Imagine my relief when I discovered this page works nice in both IE 5.5 and 5.0 (though a slight menu anomaly on the latter). :)

_Update:_ Thanks to Yousif Al Saif at TredoSoft there is now [an installer that installs IE 3.0-6.0 side by side on your computer! Recommended.](http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE)
