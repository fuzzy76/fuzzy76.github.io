I&#8217;ve tried several programs to help diagnose diskspace usage. All of them were stand-alone apps that scanned a specied folder and it&#8217;s subfolders, giving you various views over disk usage (folder trees, piecharts and in some cases weird block-diagrams). But today I stumbled upon [Folder Size](http://foldersize.sourceforge.net/), a superb solution. What it basically does is add a system service that keeps track of folder sizes on request (with caching and change notifications) together with a new column in Explorer called &#8220;Folder Size&#8221;, which behaves like the normal size column except that it also adds the total size of folders (instead of the blank space the normal size column displays). This explanation might look a bit messy, but just click the link and look at the screenshot! :)
