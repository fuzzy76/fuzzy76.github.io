As some of my readers might know, I started using [Horde webmail](http://www.horde.org/) (and it&#8217;s addons) half a year ago. But after a while, I just had to cave in. Even when running against a local IMAP server on a computer with plenty of CPU-power and RAM left, it was very sluggish. On top of that you had a terrible user interface that forced you into way too many clicks to perform even the simplest tasks. I needed something snappier and easier.

<img class="float-left img-fluid w-50 mr-2" alt="Google Home" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/google_home.png">So the time came to revisit my old friend, Google. I imported all my old mail into GMail using [GMail Loader](http://www.marklyon.org/) and set all my other mail accounts to forward into it. Since GMail lets you reply to mail with the same from-adress you received the original mail to, this setup is transparent to people you communicate with. :) I also moved my todo-lists to the Google Personalized Homepage todo gadget, my notes to Google Notebook, my calendars to Google Calendar, my RSS-feeds to Google Reader (which by far is the best online RSS-reader I&#8217;ve tried, and I&#8217;ve tried a lot!) and presto! I&#8217;m back at the [Google Personalized Homepage](http://www.google.com/ig). After trying it a while, I really can&#8217;t say I regret the migration. It has everything I need and then some. :) Click on the picture to see what it looks like right now.

And with Google recently adding [Tabs and drag&#8217;n&#8217;drop](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/Google-Gadgets-API/browse_thread/thread/d75ae9fd66bbb48c/e180ee329d73a6df#e180ee329d73a6df) to their API, developing new gadgets should be a breeze! :)
