Via [Learn Out Loud](http://www.learnoutloud.com/content/blog/archives/2006/11/the_top_10_argu.html) you can read about why DRM is a bad, bad thing&#8230; And for the less technical of my readers, DRM is the copy protection on all music bought online from MSN (for your Zune player) or iTunes (for the iPod). This is a must read, the end of the article contains a lot of tips on where to get music without DRM, even cheaper than MSN and iTunes!
