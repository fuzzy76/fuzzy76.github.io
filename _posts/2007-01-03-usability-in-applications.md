My pet peeve regarding usability is the lack of (let&#8217;s face it, most) developers ability to put themselves in the situation of computer beginners (aka newbs). Eric S. Raymond describes exactly how bad this can get in [The Luxury of Ignorance](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cups-horror.html). And in my own opinion, this also describes why Linux is still miles away from being a viable desktop alternative for the regular Joe. I&#8217;ve had too many similar encounters like this myself.

A key point in understanding users is also discussed in Raymond Chen&#8217;s [The default answer to every dialog box is &#8220;cancel&#8221;](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/01/54734.aspx). Nice to see that Microsoft has people around that realizes this. Now if they could only understand that the default answer to security alerts is &#8220;allow&#8221; as well (atleast after the users learn what cancel does to them), they&#8217;d probably understand why those are useless aswell. ;)

Todays lesson? People shouldn&#8217;t need to read manuals to get things working, and they don&#8217;t read dialog boxes. I&#8217;ve always meant that any piece of software should be so straight forward that the manual becomes redundant.
