It started as a generic include-script for the redesign of my commercial homepage, [Pedersen Mediaconsult](http://www.pmedia.no/) and suddenly I got an epiphany. ;)

Introducing&#8230; The [OneFileFramework](http://www.pmedia.no/off/), a complete (well, sort of) web framework in PHP that consists of ONE single file (index.php) consisting of 27 actual code lines. :D

The webpage I set up for it (and the demo) pretty much explains it all (form validation, MVC-orientation and so on). I haven&#8217;t set up any way of providing feedback for it yet, though. So I&#8217;d like comments to be posted to this blog entry.

I&#8217;d especially like to hear if anyone can find a way to fool OFF into security attacks using the $p parameter.
