[Thomas Baekdal shows how clicking on a link that says &#8220;Download silverlight&#8221; still takes you through 7 pages before giving you the actual file!](http://www.baekdal.com/notes/work/Silverlight-1-0-download/) I know Microsofts websites are bad from a usability perspective, but this is truly horrible. Isn&#8217;t anyone actually thinking things through in Redmond?
