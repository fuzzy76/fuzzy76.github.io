Nearly all news sources has some posts I&#8217;m not interested in. I can&#8217;t believe no RSS readers has implemented good enough filters yet. But I anyway I wrote my own. :) I don&#8217;t think my server can handle too much usage, so I&#8217;m just giving you the code as is.

**edit:** The code is now on [GitHub](https://github.com/fuzzy76/rssfilter)!

Install to a PHP5 server and use like this (fictional example):

`http://yourserver.com/rssfilter/index.php?input=http%3A%2F%2Fvg.no%2Ffeed&categories%5B%5D=Sport&categories%5B%5D=Rampelys`

The script returns a RSS feed with only entries in one of the chosen categories. It does no caching or header support, so it uses much more resources than necessary. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t tell where my personal installation is. :)
