I wanted a script to show a random quote from [bash.org](http://bash.org) in every new terminal session. PHP is my language of choice. :) <del>Save as &#8220;bashquote&#8221; and chmod 755 (rwxr-xr-x) to use (make sure the regexp looks exactly as below in preg_match_all()). The script only works in a Unix/Linux environment.</del>

Edit 15. april 2015: The code has been moved to [Github](https://github.com/fuzzy76/bashquote)! :)
