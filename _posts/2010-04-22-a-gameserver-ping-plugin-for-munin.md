My personal server has been acting up lately, to be precise; the Call of Duty (1) gameserver that runs on it. I installed [Munin](http://munin-monitoring.org/) for monitoring it, but really wanted something that would show the actual slowdown the players experienced.

So I did a Munin plugin. In PHP ofcourse. ;) It&#8217;s my first Munin plugin, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it turns out to be the only one written in PHP. It&#8217;s available for download at [Munin Exchange](http://muninexchange.projects.linpro.no/?search&cid=40&pid=566), and the code is here for those that just want a quick look.

**Update 27.04.10:** Updated the plugin to v1.1.

**Update 03.07.15:** Updated the plugin to v1.11 and moved to GitHub.

**The code is now at <https://github.com/fuzzy76/munin_qstatping>**
